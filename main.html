  <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>Time complexity is a measure of how the runtime of an algorithm grows with the size of the input. It helps us analyze whether an algorithm is efficient and scalable when processing large amounts of data.</p>

  <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires relative to the input size. For example, an algorithm that needs additional memory proportional to the input size has a space complexity of O(n).</p>
